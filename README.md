I consider myself a person with active thinking and learning strategies with excellent skills for complex problem solving on machine learning and teamwork. On the other hand, I am a creative, innovative and responsible person, besides having skills for programming work.

## My passion
My passion is artificial intelligence and how it can be applied in business or in more complex problem solving such as computer vision, among other things. Programming is another area that I am more passionate about, so combining them I do what I like the most. As a last point, it is important to mention that I am passionate about English and Chinese, although I am still learning the latter, as well as I am active learning languages, I also love to learn new programming languages.
